# UNiDAYS Coding Style Guide

The aim of this project is to assist anyone contributing to any of the UNiDAYS open source projects. The documents contained in this repository are to help you navigate and conform to the UNiDAYS standard practices.

This is to be considered the 'source of truth'. The contributing docs from UNiDAYS open source repositories will link to the style guides relevant to them.

This is the way UNiDAYS currently work, but we are open to suggestion if you disagree with anything in these style guides. Open a pull request, following the instructions outlined in the [contributing guidelines](.github/contributing.md) to give your suggestions.

**NOTE:**
> This project is currently under maintenance. The aim is to move all style guides to a more navigable and readable markdown format. If there is a style guide you think is missing / needed, please raise an issue or pull request.
